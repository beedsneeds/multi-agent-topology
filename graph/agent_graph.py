# Graph Architecture - explicit representation of agent communication

# Why this file needed?
# - In future while working with dynamic topology, we need to have a data structure that represents a topology which we will work with that generate based on the prompt.
# Till now topology is just a string like topology = "single" or "chain".
# For Dynamic, it will be like topology = AgentGraph(nodes=[...], edges=[...])


# How it connects to other files (rest of the code)?
#   topology_selector.py (Stage 3) will call build_topology_for_task() and get back an AgentGraph.
#   run_pipeline() will execute that AgentGraph.
#   LangSmith and wandb will log its structure as metadata.

# TODO why are the topologies being recreated here?

    SEQUENTIAL:  A must finish before B starts. Classic pipeline.

    PARALLEL:    A sends to B and C simultaneously. B and C run at the same time.
                 Example: Planner -> [WebSearch, CodeExecutor] (concurrent)
                 LangGraph supports this natively.

    CONDITIONAL: A routes to B or C depending on a condition.
                 Example: Router -> SimpleAgent (if Level 1) | ComplexAgent (if Level 3)
                 This is what your dynamic topology selection becomes.

    FEEDBACK:    B sends back to A (revision loop).
                 Example: Evaluator -> Coder (if code fails QA)
                 CRITICAL: always has max_traversals to prevent infinite loops.
